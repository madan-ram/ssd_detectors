1. Learn how each commponent can be modified, clear about the concepts. (Done)
2. Print every leayer, with name, with, theoretical receptive field. (Done)
3. Change layer to accomodate dilated layer, its and filed of view. (In-Progress)
4. Get data from Generation script from Ridhima. (Hold)
5. Check bb prediction of each block.

6. Optimize aspect ratio and test model? (Done)
6. Why resnet and how resnet works? (In-progress)
7. Write the model observation report for all v7 model.
8. random genration of model using plug and play components. Genetic modeling for model development.
9. Create program to evaluate the model and generate report
	1. Classification accuracy.
	2. Background noise accuracy.
	3. Size distribution of predicted bounding box per prediction layer

Generate various data agumented image as generate in train, and find the each block effective prediction size and per layer
